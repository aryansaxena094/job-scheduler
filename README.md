### Backend (Spring Boot)
- **Core Responsibilities**:
  - **Job Management**: Implement RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting jobs. Each job can have attributes like ID, description, priority, status, and dependencies.
  - **Scheduling Logic**: Develop a scheduling service that uses a priority queue to manage and execute jobs based on their priorities and dependencies. This service will check for job readiness and dispatch ready jobs for execution.
  - **Concurrency Management**: Use Java's concurrency utilities to handle the simultaneous execution of independent jobs.
  - **Database Integration**: Use Spring Data JPA to interact with a relational database (like PostgreSQL) for persisting job information and their dependencies.
  - **Security**: Implement basic authentication or OAuth to secure the API.

### Frontend (React or Angular)
- **Key Features**:
  - **Dashboard**: A user interface that displays all jobs in the system with their current status (pending, in-progress, completed, failed).
  - **Job Submission Form**: A form to submit new jobs, specifying details like description, priority, and dependencies (selectable from existing jobs).
  - **Real-Time Updates**: Utilize WebSockets to update the job status in real-time on the user dashboard.
  - **Job Editing and Deletion**: Interfaces to modify or remove existing jobs.

### Sample App Flow:
1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users log in to the system.
   - They are greeted by a dashboard showing all jobs.
   - They can submit new jobs through a form, specifying necessary details and dependencies.
   - As jobs are processed in the backend, their status updates are pushed to the frontend in real-time.

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - The backend receives job submissions and stores them in the database.
   - The job scheduler continuously checks for jobs that are ready to run (i.e., all dependencies are completed).
   - Ready jobs are executed in order of priority, and their status updates (in-progress, completed) are stored and broadcasted to the frontend.

3. **Technologies to Use**:
   - **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, WebSocket.
   - **Frontend**: ReactJS or Angular, Redux for state management, Axios for API calls, Socket.IO for real-time communication.

### Development Steps:
1. **Setup Project Base**: Initialize the Spring Boot project and the React/Angular project.
2. **Develop API**: Create the necessary REST API in Spring Boot.
3. **Database Schema**: Design and implement the database schema.
4. **Implement Scheduling Logic**: Code the logic for job scheduling considering priorities and dependencies.
5. **Build Frontend**: Develop the frontend components, connect them to the backend via API, and implement real-time communication.
6. **Testing and Refinement**: Test the system thoroughly, refine the UI/UX and backend logic based on test outcomes.
