### Project Choice: E-commerce Warehouse Order Fulfillment System
This project will involve creating systems for managing order processing in a warehouse, focusing on the picking, packing, and shipping phases. It's practical, scalable, and involves complex logic that can benefit from data structures and algorithms.

### Division of Work
1. **Backend (You)**
   - **Spring Boot for REST API**: Develop the APIs needed for frontend interactions.
   - **Database Management**: Design and manage databases for storing order, inventory, and shipping details.
   - **Business Logic**: Implement the algorithms for prioritizing and scheduling orders based on various criteria (like shipping deadlines, order size, inventory location).

2. **Frontend (Your Friend)**
   - **User Interface**: Develop the interfaces for displaying orders, statuses, and actions (like pick, pack, ship).
   - **Redux for State Management**: Manage application state, ensuring that the UI reacts correctly to changes and user interactions.
   - **Real-Time Updates**: Implement WebSocket or polling to update the status of orders in real-time.

### Quick Development Tips:
- **Start with Basic Features**: Focus initially on critical features like listing orders, updating statuses, and integrating basic backend logic.
- **Iterative Development**: Develop incrementally, ensuring each part works before moving to the next. For instance, start with basic CRUD operations and then integrate more complex logic like order scheduling.
- **Use Tools and Libraries**: Utilize libraries like Axios for API requests, Thymeleaf or React-Bootstrap for UI components, and Spring Boot starters for rapid development.
- **Focus on Communication**: Regular syncs between backend and frontend development to ensure compatibility and to integrate smoothly.
